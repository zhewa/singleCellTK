\title{Construct SCE object from seqc output}
\usage{
importSEQC(
  seqcDirs = NULL,
  samples = NULL,
  prefix = NULL,
  gzipped = FALSE,
  class = c("Matrix", "matrix"),
  delayedArray = TRUE,
  cbNotFirstCol = TRUE,
  feNotFirstCol = TRUE,
  combinedSample = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqcDirs}{A vector of paths to seqc output files. Each sample
should have its own path. For example: \code{./pbmc_1k_50x50}.
Must have the same length as \code{samples}.}

\item{samples}{A vector of user-defined sample names for the samples to be
imported. Must have the same length as \code{seqcDirs}.}

\item{prefix}{A vector containing the prefix of file names within each
sample directory. It cannot be null and the vector should have the same
length as \emph{samples}.}

\item{gzipped}{Boolean. \code{TRUE} if the seqc output files
 (sparse_counts_barcode.csv, sparse_counts_genes.csv, and
 sparse_molecule_counts.mtx)
 were gzip compressed. \code{FALSE} otherwise. Default seqc outputs are
 not gzipped.
Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{class}{Character. The class of the expression matrix stored in the SCE
object. Can be one of "Matrix" (as returned by
\link{readMM} function), or "matrix" (as returned by
\link[base]{matrix} function). Default "Matrix".}

\item{delayedArray}{Boolean. Whether to read the expression matrix as
\link{DelayedArray} object or not. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cbNotFirstCol}{Boolean. \code{TRUE} if first column of
 sparse_counts_barcode.csv
is row index and it will be removed. \code{FALSE} the first column will
 be kept.}

\item{feNotFirstCol}{Boolean. \code{TRUE} if first column of
 sparse_counts_genes.csv
is row index and it will be removed. \code{FALSE} the first column will
 be kept.}

\item{combinedSample}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, \code{importSEQC} returns a
\code{SingleCellExperiment} object containing the combined count matrix,
 feature annotations
 and the cell annotations. If \code{FALSE}, \code{importSEQC} returns a
 list containing multiple
 \code{SingleCellExperiment} objects. Each \code{SingleCellExperiment}
 contains count matrix, feature annotations and cell annotations for
 each sample.}
}
\value{
A \code{SingleCellExperiment} object containing the combined count
 matrix, the feature annotations, and the cell annotation.
}
\description{
Read the filtered barcodes, features, and matrices for all
 samples from (preferably a single run of) seqc output. Import and
 combine them as one big \link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}
 object.
}
\details{
\code{importSEQC} imports output from seqc.
 The default sparse_counts_barcode.csv or sparse_counts_genes.csv from
 seqc output
 contains two columns. The first column is row index and the second column
 is cell-barcode
 or gene symbol. \code{importSEQC} will remove first column. Alternatively,
 user can call
 \code{cbNotFirstCol} or \code{feNotFirstCol} as FALSE to keep the first
 column of these files.
 When \code{combinedSample} is TRUE, \code{importSEQC} will combined count
 matrix with genes detected in at least one sample.

\examples{
# Example #1
# The following filtered feature, cell, and matrix files were downloaded from
# https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/
# 3.0.0/pbmc_1k_v3
# The top 50 hg38 genes are included in this example.
# Only the top 50 cells are included.
