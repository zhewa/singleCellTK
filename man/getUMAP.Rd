\usage{
getUMAP(
  inSCE,
  useAssay = "counts",
  useAltExp = NULL,
  sample = NULL,
  reducedDimName = "UMAP",
  logNorm = TRUE,
  nNeighbors = 30,
  nIterations = 200,
  alpha = 1,
  minDist = 0.01,
  spread = 1,
  pca = TRUE,
  initialDims = 50
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inSCE}{Input \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object.}

\item{useAssay}{Assay to use for UMAP computation. If \code{useAltExp} is
specified, \code{useAssay} has to exist in
\code{assays(altExp(inSCE, useAltExp))}. Default \code{"counts"}.}

\item{useAltExp}{The subset to use for UMAP computation, usually for the
selected.variable features. Default \code{NULL}.}

\item{sample}{Character vector. Indicates which sample each cell belongs to.
If given a single character, will take the annotation from
\code{\link{colData}}. Default \code{NULL}.}

\item{reducedDimName}{A name to store the results of the dimension reduction
coordinates obtained from this method. Default \code{"UMAP"}.}

\item{logNorm}{Whether the counts will need to be log-normalized prior to
generating the UMAP via \code{\link{logNormCounts}}. Default
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{nNeighbors}{The size of local neighborhood used for manifold
approximation. Larger values result in more global views of the manifold,
while smaller values result in more local data being preserved. Default
\code{30}. See `?uwot::umap` for more information.}

\item{nIterations}{The number of iterations performed during layout
optimization. Default is \code{200}.}

\item{alpha}{The initial value of "learning rate" of layout optimization.
Default is \code{1}.}

\item{minDist}{The effective minimum distance between embedded points.
Smaller values will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby
points on the manifold are drawn closer together, while larger values will
result on a more even dispersal of points. Default \code{0.01}. See
`?uwot::umap` for more information.}

\item{spread}{The effective scale of embedded points. In combination with
minDist, this determines how clustered/clumped the embedded points are.
Default \code{1}. See `?uwot::umap` for more information.}

\item{pca}{Logical. Whether to perform dimension reduction with PCA before
UMAP. Default \code{TRUE}}

\item{initialDims}{Number of dimensions from PCA to use as input in UMAP.
Default \code{50}.}
